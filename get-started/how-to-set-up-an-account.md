# How to set up an account

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Go to GetBlock

Visit the [homepage](https://getblock.io/) and click on the 'Dashboard' button in the upper-right corner, or use [this direct link](https://account.getblock.io/sign-up).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose the sign-up method

*   **Register with Email**

    Enter your name and email address, then verify your email to activate the account.
