# Top up requests and boost RPS

The current request balance for shared node users is displayed on the Dashboard. This shows how many requests you can make before running out.

### Top up requests

The Top Up balance feature allows you to add more requests to your account or upgrade to higher monthly request limits.

* **Free Plan users**: Can upgrade to paid services, starting with the ‘Start’ package for one month.
* **Start plan users**: Can refill the balance of requests or upgrade to a higher-tier plan with increased limits.

How to add requests:

1. Click the Top up button on the Dashboard.
2. Select a recommended package based on your plan.
3. Confirm and finalize your purchase.
4. Your request balance is updated immediately after a successful top-up.

With that, you can quickly adjust your plan on demand.

### Boost RPS

The Boost RPS feature targets speed and throughput. It is available for **Unlimited Plan** users to increase their default Requests Per Second (RPS) limit.&#x20;

How to Boost RPS:

1. Click the Boost button on the Dashboard.
2. Submit a request through the contact form.
3. The updated RPS limit is applied to your account shortly after approval.

Now, your application can handle more simultaneous requests to the blockchain network.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The feature is perfect for users who need higher transaction throughput without changing their plan. For more demanding needs, consider [Dedicated Nodes](https://getblock.io/dedicated-nodes/) or [Enterprise](https://getblock.io/enterprise-api/) solutions.\
