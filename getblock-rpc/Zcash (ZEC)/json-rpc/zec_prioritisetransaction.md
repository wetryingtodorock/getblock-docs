### Parameters


`txid` - string

The transaction id.

`priority delta` - numeric

The priority to add or subtract.

The transaction selection algorithm considers the tx as it would have a
higher priority.

(priority of a transaction is calculated: coinage \* value_in_satoshis /
txsize)

`fee delta` - numeric

The fee value (in satoshis) to add (or subtract, if negative).

The fee is not actually paid, only the algorithm for selecting
transactions into a block considers the transaction as it would have
paid a higher (or lower) fee.
