# Postman Collection

This comprehensive Postman collection encompasses all the accessible endpoints of our nodes, providing you with a complete toolkit for interacting with our services.

Within this collection, you'll find demonstration requests designed to retrieve the last block using various methods. These examples serve as practical starting points for your interactions.

By importing this collection into your Postman workspace, you can gain access to the specific nodes you need. The process is straightforwardâ€”simply retrieve your unique access token from [your account](https://account.getblock.io/), and insert it into the designated field labeled <your_access_token>. This token will grant you the necessary permissions to explore our node functionalities.

## Procedure:

- To access the collection, click the following link: [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28751185/2s9YRDzqcX](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28751185/2s9YRDzqcX)

- Once the page loads, you'll find a 'Run in Postman' button in the top-right corner. Click this button to open the collection directly in your Postman application;

- In Postman, you can easily select the desired network from the drop-down list on the sidebar;
