### Parameters


`submethod` - string

None

`proTxHash` - string (hex)

The hash of the provider transaction as hex in RPC byte order.

`ipAndPort` - string

IP and port in the form IP:PORT.

Must be unique on the network. Can be set to 0, which will require a
ProUpServTx afterwards.

`operatorPubKey` - string (hex)

The operator public key. The private key does not have to be known. It
has to match the private key which is later used when operating the
masternode.

If set to an empty string, the currently active operator BLS public key
is reused.

`operatorPayoutAddress` - string (hex)

Optional.

The Dash address used for operator reward payments. Only allowed when
the ProRegTx had a non-zero operatorReward value.

If set to an empty string, the currently active payout address is
reused.

`feeSourceAddress` - string

Optional.

If specified, the wallet will only use coins from this address to fund
the ProTx. If not specified, payoutAddress will be used. The private key
belonging to this address must be known in your wallet.
