### Parameters


`Address` - string (base58)

The P2PKH address corresponding to the private key which made the
signature. A P2PKH address is a hash of the public key corresponding to
the private key which made the signature.

When the ECDSA signature is checked, up to four possible ECDSA public
keys will be reconstructed from from the signature; each key will be
hashed and compared against the P2PKH address provided to see if any of
them match.

If there are no matches, signature validation will fail.

`Signature` - string (base58)

The signature created by the signer encoded as base-64 (the format
output by the signmessage RPC)

`Message` - string

The message exactly as it was signed (e.g. no extra whitespace).
