### Parameters


`Confirmations` - number (int)

Optional.

The minimum number of confirmations an externally-generated transaction
must have before it is counted towards the balance. Transactions
generated by this node are counted immediately. Typically,
externally-generated transactions are payments to this wallet and
transactions generated by this node are payments to other wallets.

Use 0 to count unconfirmed transactions. Default is 1.

`addlocked` - bool

Optional.

Add the balance from InstantSend locked transactions.

`Include Empty` - bool

Optional.

Set to true to display accounts which have never received a payment.

Set to false (the default) to only include accounts which have received
a payment.

Any account which has received a payment will be displayed even if its
current balance is 0.

`Include Watch-Only` - bool

Optional.

If set to true, include watch-only addresses in details and calculations
as if they were regular addresses belonging to the wallet.

If set to false (the default), treat watch-only addresses as if they
didn't belong to this wallet.

`Address Filter` - string

Optional.

If present, only return information for this address.

Added in Dash Core 0.17.0
