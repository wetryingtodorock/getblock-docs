### Parameters


`mode` - string

The command mode to use:

\- genkey - Generates a base64 encoded 256 bit AES key that can be used
for the communication with KeePassHttp. This is only necessary for
manual configuration.

\- init - Sets up the association between Dash Core and KeePass by
generating an AES key and sending an association message to KeePassHttp.
This will trigger KeePass to ask for an Id for the association. Returns
the association and the base64 encoded string for the AES key.

\- setpassphrase - Updates the passphrase in KeePassHttp to a new value.
This should match the passphrase you intend to use for the wallet.
Please note that the standard RPC commands walletpassphrasechange and
the wallet encryption from the QT GUI already send the updates to
KeePassHttp, so this is only necessary for manual manipulation of the
password.
