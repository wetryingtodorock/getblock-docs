given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates
and cause an error.

The fee amount to attach to this transaction.

as will fit in the transaction.

Optional, default is 20 Sprout or 200 Sapling Notes

Limit on the maximum number of notes to merge. Set to 0 to merge as many
as will fit in the transaction.
