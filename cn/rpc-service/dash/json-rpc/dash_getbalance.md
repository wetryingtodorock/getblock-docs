### Parameters


`Unused` - string

Deprecated: (previously account) will be removed in a later version of
Dash Core

Remains for backward compatibility. Must be excluded or set to "\*".

`Confirmations` - number (int)

Optional.

The minimum number of confirmations an externally-generated transaction
must have before it is counted towards the balance. Transactions
generated by this node are counted immediately. Typically,
externally-generated transactions are payments to this wallet and
transactions generated by this node are payments to other wallets.

Use 0 to count unconfirmed transactions. Default is 1.

`addlocked` - bool

Optional.

Add the balance from InstantSend locked transactions.

`Include Watch-Only` - bool

Optional.

If set to true, include watch-only addresses in details and calculations
as if they were regular addresses belonging to the wallet.

If set to false (the default), treat watch-only addresses as if they
didn't belong to this wallet.
