To effectively use the Ethereum methods listed above, you'll need a reliable tool to send requests to the network. One such tool is Axios, a lightweight and widely used HTTP client. With Axios, you can easily interact with Ethereum's JSON-RPC API to execute transactions, retrieve blockchain data, and much more.

#### Quickstart with Axios

Axios is a powerful HTTP client that streamlines communication with APIs, including Ethereum's JSON-RPC interface. By using Axios, developers can effortlessly send requests and process responses, making blockchain integration straightforward and efficient. Below, we provide a detailed guide to help you get started:

Developers new to Ethereum can efficiently interact with the Ethereum API by leveraging Axios, a well-regarded HTTP client. It simplifies API integration, making it user-friendly and effective. Here’s how you can get started:

**1. Set Up Your Project**

Choose a package manager and initialize your project:

```
mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
cd ethereum-api-quickstart
npm init --yes
```

Or, using Yarn:

```
mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
cd ethereum-api-quickstart
yarn init -y
```

**2. Install Axios**

Install Axios to make API requests:

```
npm install axios
```

Or, using Yarn:

```
yarn add axios
```

**3. Make Your First Request**

Set up a new file named index.js and insert the code snippet provided below:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";


const url = `https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/`;


const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
};


axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Latest block number', parseInt(response.data.result, 16));
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

Replace \<ACCESS-TOKEN> with your actual API key from the GetBlock. You can also use other networks by replacing the URL with those of Sepolia or Holesky testnets.

**4. Run Your Script**

Execute your script with:

node index.js

You should see the latest block number logged to your console.

***

#### Conclusion

The Ethereum network methods are versatile and cater to diverse use cases, from simple account balance queries to advanced transaction tracing. The added quickstart guide demonstrates how to leverage Axios for making efficient API requests, enabling developers to start building on Ethereum seamlessly. By categorizing and simplifying these concepts, this overview aims to enhance productivity for both new and experienced Ethereum developers.
