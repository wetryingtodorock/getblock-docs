To effectively use the Ethereum methods listed above, you'll need a reliable tool to send requests to the network. One such tool is Axios, a lightweight and widely used HTTP client. With Axios, you can easily interact with Ethereum's JSON-RPC API to execute transactions, retrieve blockchain data, and much more.

#### Quickstart with Axios

Axios is a powerful HTTP client that streamlines communication with APIs, including Ethereum's JSON-RPC interface. By using Axios, developers can effortlessly send requests and process responses, making blockchain integration straightforward and efficient. Below, we provide a detailed guide to help you get started:

Developers new to Ethereum can efficiently interact with the Ethereum API by leveraging Axios, a well-regarded HTTP client. It simplifies API integration, making it user-friendly and effective. Here’s how you can get started:

**1. Set Up Your Project**

Choose a package manager and initialize your project:

```
mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
cd ethereum-api-quickstart
npm init --yes
```

Or, using Yarn:

```
mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
cd ethereum-api-quickstart
yarn init -y
```

**2. Install Axios**

Install Axios to make API requests:

```
npm install axios
```

Or, using Yarn:

```
yarn add axios
```

**3. Make Your First Request**

Set up a new file named index.js and insert the code snippet provided below:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";


const url = `https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/`;


const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
};


axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Latest block number', parseInt(response.data.result, 16));
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

Replace \<ACCESS-TOKEN> with your actual API key from the GetBlock. You can also use other networks by replacing the URL with those of Sepolia or Holesky testnets.

**4. Run Your Script**

Execute your script with:

node index.js

You should see the latest block number logged to your console.\


#### Quickstart with Python and requests

requests is a powerful and easy-to-use HTTP library for Python that simplifies API interactions, including Ethereum’s JSON-RPC API. With requests, developers can send requests, handle responses, and easily integrate blockchain functionality into their projects. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get started:

**1. Set Up Your Project**

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
cd ethereum-api-quickstart
```

Set up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the requests library:

```bash
 pip install requests
```

**2. Write Your First Script**

Create a new file called main.py and insert the following code:

```python
python import requests

# Replace <ACCESS-TOKEN> with your actual API key from GetBlock
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"

# Create a JSON-RPC payload
payload = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "eth_blockNumber",
    "params": []
}

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

try:
    # Send the POST request
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check for HTTP errors
    data = response.json()

    # Convert the result to a decimal number and print it
    latest_block = int(data["result"], 16)
    print(f"Latest block number: {latest_block}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
except KeyError:
    print("Unexpected response format:", response.text)
```

**3. Run Your Script**

Execute the script with:

```bash
 python main.py
```

You should see the latest block number retrieved from the Ethereum network printed to your console.
