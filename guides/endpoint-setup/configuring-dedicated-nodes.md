# Configuring dedicated nodes

To create a [dedicated node](https://getblock.io/dedicated-nodes/) endpoint, switch over to the ‘Dedicated Nodes’ tab in the Dashboard.

Select a blockchain protocol you wish to deploy and the network type. Click **Get** to begin the setup process. In the setup window:

1. Review and confirm your selected protocol and network.
2. Select a subscription plan (available discounts are applied automatically).
3. Customize your dedicated node with the following options:
   1. **Node type**: Choose between Full Node or Archive Node.
   2. **Node client**: Specify your preferred node implementation.
   3. **API Interface**: Select API options.&#x20;
4. Verify all selected configurations in the summary section and proceed to checkout.&#x20;

Pay for your dedicated nodes via your GetBlock account. If additional support is required during setup, you can contact the GetBlock support team directly.

You can add more dedicated nodes following these steps. Add as many access tokens for each dedicated node as you need.
