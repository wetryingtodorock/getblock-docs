Generate and add as many access tokens as required for this protocol. Each token is a unique endpoint for you and your application to interact with the blockchain.

### Viewing and managing access tokens

* To see all the access tokens generated for a specific protocol, simply expand the endpoint.
* Each protocol has a configuration file that includes all relevant access token details.
* The All Access Tokens Configuration file is located next to the My Endpoints section. Use it to review and manage your tokens.
